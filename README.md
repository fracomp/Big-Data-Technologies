Highlights: Implementation of R-tree and Data Analysis 

The goal of the first assignment is to provide data analysis within the context of a business application. The topic I am going to cover is about patient comments in regards to drug effects.
The initial dataset can be found with the name DRUG_REPORTS in the SAS drive.

I decided to develop all the analysis in Python, with the support of Jupyter notebook that allows me to mix code with text.
The assignment 2 goal is to build an efficient R-tree which is able to quickly answer query in 2d points.
